repl_path = '/path/to/repl'  # Path to Lean REPL
proj_path = '/path/to/proj'  # Path to a Lean project with mathlib/other deps

# Use as context manager
with LeanRepl(repl_path, proj_path) as repl:
    response = repl.interact("def f : Nat := 5")
    # ...

# ...or as an object
repl = LeanRepl(repl_path, proj_path)
repl.open()
response = repl.interact("def f : Nat := 5")
# ...
repl.close()
```
